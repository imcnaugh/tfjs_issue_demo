This is a quick demo of an issue I have run into with tensorflow js, and converting/loading a model trained in python, into a tensorflow js project.

There are 2 important files in this project:
 - 'train_and_save_model.py' - this file trains a simple model and saves it to disk
 - 'load_and_predict_model.js' - this file loads the model and tries to make a prediction

for 'train_and_save_model.py' I am using
 - Python 3.11.9
 - keras 3.4.1
 - tensorflow 2.16.1
 - tensorflowjs 4.6.0

for 'load_and_predict_model.js' I am using
    - Node.js v20.15.0
    - @tensorflow/tfjs 4.20.0

I use the following command to convert the model:
```bash
python train_and_save_model.py
```

That will save a model.json and weights file to the `tfjs-model` directory.
I have included the model.json and weights files in this repo, so you can skip the training step.

Then I use the following command to run the node.js script:
```bash
node load_and_run_model.js
```

to start a simple express server to host the model file and expose the endpoint to make load the model and make a prediction.

curling the endpoint with 
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/predict
```

and that will show the error, 
```
ValueError: An InputLayer should be passed either a `batchInputShape` or an `inputShape`.

```

now i have done some investigation and documented it [here](https://discuss.tensorflow.org/t/corrupted-configuration-and-batch-input-shape-loading-pre-trained-layers-model-in-tensorflow-js/24977/5)

but what it seems to come down to is the model.json file needs to have the `batch_shape` property renamed to `batch_input_shape`

and the `inbound_nodes` array needs to be simplified

for instance what is produced from the python script is:

```json
"inbound_nodes": [
  {
    "args": [
      {
        "class_name": "__keras_tensor__",
        "config": {
          "shape": [
            null,
            1
          ],
          "dtype": "float32",
          "keras_history": [
            "input_layer",
            0,
            0
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "kwargs": {}
  }
]
```

but when I modify it to look similar to the following: thing work
```json
"inbound_nodes": [
  [
    [
      "input_layer",
      0,
      0
    ]
  ]
]
```

I have included the modified model.json file in the `tfjs-model` directory as `working-model.json`, so you can see the difference.
